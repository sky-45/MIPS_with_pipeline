# MIPS_with_pipeline
An implementation in VHDL of a reduced Mips Instruction Set for the course of Computer Architecture.
The main file is "mips_pipe.vhd", the Pipeline have 5 stages and is based on the book "David PATTERSON y John HENNESSY. Computer Organization & Design: The Hardware/Software 
Interface, 4th Edition. Editorial Morgan Kaufmann, 2009. (5th Edition, 2014)".
Most of the arithmetic and logical operations have been implemented, apart from that only the branch equal and jump operations have been implemented, too busy to finish the entire Instruction Set.
